# New-York-Hotel-Price-Analysis

This project analyzes hotel pricing data in New York City using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and potentially PySpark. \
It explores various aspects, including:

Feature Engineering: Adding new features to the dataset (DayDiff, WeekDay, Discount Calculation) for enhanced analysis.  \
Discount Code Prediction: Classifying the most suitable discount code for a given hotel stay based on various parameters using Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost algorithms. \
Hotel Clustering: Grouping hotels with similar pricing patterns through Hierarchical Clustering. \
Price Prediction: Implementing a model to predict future discounted prices for hotels using sampling techniques.
